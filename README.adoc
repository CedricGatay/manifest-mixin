= Docker mixin generator

== How to build

You will need to have a working Go environment (http://golang.org)

`go build` will generate a working executable file.

== Expected file syntax

------
# Classic Docker syntax
# MIX repo/image:tag
# MIX URI
------

== Main concept
Grab matching dockerfiles (see if something in Docker is useable)

Generate content like the following : 

------
# BEGIN MIXIN repo/image:tag
# FROM repo/image:tag
# MAINTAINER <you@tld.com>
# Hash : SHA1 of the revision (if applicable)
<Content of the dockerFile>
# END MIXIN repo/image:tag
------

== Technical constraints

Choose a language allowing to run everywhere without much dependencies

 * shell script / batch windows
 * go 
 * java (native)
 * c
