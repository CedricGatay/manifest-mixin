= Docker mixin generator

== How to build

You will need to have a working Go environment (http://golang.org)

`go build` will generate a working executable file.

== Expected file syntax

------
# Classic Docker syntax
# MIX repo/image:tag
# MIX URI
------

== Main concept
Grab matching dockerfiles (see if something in Docker is useable)

Generate content like the following : 

------
# BEGIN MIXIN repo/image:tag
# FROM repo/image:tag
# MAINTAINER <you@tld.com>
# Hash : SHA1 of the revision (if applicable)
<Content of the dockerFile>
# END MIXIN repo/image:tag
------

== Technical limits

ADD / COPY commands are likely not to work (we can't fetch remote files easily).

We won't help with command targeted at different base OSes either
